The goal of this project is to create an enigma machine implimented in php.

<h2>Idea Behind Project</h2>
This project was started after ErdMutter92 watched a few youtube episodes on the Enigma Code used in WWII by the Nazi's to encrypt their military communications. This project aims to implement a group of php classes that represent the Enigma Machine as well as the Bomba. At the end of this project there will be a way to encrypt, decrypt, and crack Enigma Code.

<h2>About the Cog</h2>
The cog class represents a Cog Object. Where you define what type of Cog is and the initial position of the Cog. When passed a char or a number representation it will convert it before returning it.
